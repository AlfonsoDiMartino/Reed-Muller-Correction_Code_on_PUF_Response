# Reed-Muller_Correction_Code_on_PUF_Response
VHDL implementation of Reed-Muller Coder and Decoder for SSD exam. 

The Reed-Muller Code is used in PUF-based authentication protocol such a error-correction tecnique. In the Enrollment Phase is used to encode secret random number cs to Cs, while in the Verification Phase is used tu decode the noisy version Cs'. 

This project was developed for Embedded Systems exam in collaboration with https://github.com/piliguori and https://github.com/SalvatoreBarone.
